## Force vs Energy ##
We're debating between force or energy to define the system

$F = -kx + \beta x^2 +\gamma x^3 + ...$ <br/>
vs <br/>
$\Delta U = (U-U_0) = ax +bx^2 + cx^3 + ...$ <br/>
$bx^2 = 1/(2kx^2)$

If we look at the ax term, we find that (this is partial)
$F = -\delta / \delta x \Delta U$
so
$F = -a$

By definition, equilibrium must be true.
By assumption of equilibrium, we say that (ax) approaches 0.
$U = (U-U_0)

## Pseudocode ##
We want
derive equation of motion
solve for dynamics
calculate force and energy
define deviation from linear behavior
conservation laws to check?
